We will be building out the following basic architecture:

![image](./docs/images/diagram.png)

1. Customers can create a new account with the restaurant.

2. We use a Place Index to calculate the coordinates based on the customer's postcode and store the results in DynamoDB alongside their customer account record.

3. Subsequently, a customer can place a food order for delivery, and we use the Route Calculator to calculate the estimated delivery time and distance between their address and the restaurant.

4. All customer and order records are stored in Amazon DynamoDB.
